                <h2>Q-1: Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage</h2>
                <h5>Ans:</h5>
                <p>localStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that
                    with sessionStorage , the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With
                    localStorage , the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your
                    web app clears the data.</p>

                <h2>Question-2 : Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope</h2>
                <h5>Ans:</h5>
                <p>Global Scope: If we declare any variable globaly we can use it within the program anyware </p>
                <p>Local Scope: If we declare any variable inside any scope such as inside a function then we can access
                    that variable inside that function , we are not able to access it oustside of the function .</p>

                <h2>Question-3 : How event loop work in javaScript</h2>
                <h5>Ans:</h5>
                <p>We know that javascript is Synchronous , But when it runs on Browser ,browser api provide
                    asynchronous behaviour to javaScript with the help of Event Loop . </p>
                <p>Event loop monitor the call Stack
                    and the Callback Queue . If the Call stack is empty , the Event
                    loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the call Stack , Which effectively
                    runs it .</p>

                <h2>Question-4 : How can we get undefined ?</h2>
                <h5>Ans: </h5>
                <p>we can get undefined in many ways, examples are given below:</p>
                <p>1. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it .</p>
                <p>2. if we try to access a variable that doesn't exist will give us undefined</p>
                <p>3. A function that doesn't return anything will give you undefined if you try to use it .</p>
                <p>4.A property that doesn't exist , if you want to access it , then you will get undefined.</p>
                <p>5.An array element that doesnt exist , if you want to access it you will get undefined.</p>
